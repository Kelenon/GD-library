- Implemented inidbi to persistently track supplies on server. No need to update initServer.sqf manually anymore!
- Script is now applied automatically to all valid containers and vehicles placed both in editor and spanwed by zeus! 
- Empty crates will have their health set to 0 so empty ones don't mix up with ones containing supplies

- Supply script now can only be added to valid objects, either [GAR] or [CIS] containers or SW vehicles
- You can't apply the same action to the same crate anymore
- Maximum "mod" value (third parameter has been changed to 10)
- Introduced medevac site on the Hautner composition
