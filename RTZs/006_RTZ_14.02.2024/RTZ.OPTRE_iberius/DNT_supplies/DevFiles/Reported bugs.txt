Bugs:
- animation lag
- vehicles preplaced in Eden can't be claimed by others than FIRST PERSON THAT SPAWNED
- vehicles spawned by zeus can be claimed by each players (some can't though - might be vebnicle size thing)
- vehicles spawned by curator can be scrapped by mutliple people at once (depends on vehicle, might be a matter of vehicle size which can be claimed/scrapped multiple times)
- size for zeus was 3, for other players the size was as set via function, for AAT I had 2 cargospace, for Cracker 25
- larger crates are either too far for interaction or they loose ace interaction ability
- everyone can hear someone get hit


Unresolved yet:
Interactions are too far
Wrecks can't be scrapped on server the way they can be claimed on local game. Same goes for claiming. + ifempty
After destroying unclaimed vehicle action to claim it remains


Set for testing:
After unloading the create are searchable again - made sure to removeAction on all clients after searching
on hit everyone hears it (confirm?)
Vehicles can be claimed multiple times (also multiple missions)
Animations (added remoteExec)


Fixed:
If empty box in area then depot doesnt work - fixed, changed trigger activation from anybody to anyplayer


For testing:

1. Spawn in Haunter hangar
2. Search crates and move them to supply drop
3. Spawn LAAT
4. Check cargospace
