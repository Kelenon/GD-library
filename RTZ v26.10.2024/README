Here you can find Ready To Zeus files with newest scripts version you can use as a template for your own scenarios.

All RTZ files are in PBO format! I strongly reccomend installing pboManager in order to unpack and pack pbo files. Otherwise it might be quite a hassle. File is available in the repo for download
